# base-symfony-project
Symfony skeleton with my minimal bundle

This project will be updated with symfony release.

Following bundle has been added to Symfony/skeleton :

* symfony/Server       (alias : server)
* symfony/debug-pack   (alias : debug)
* symfony/maker-bundle (alias : make)

More bundle could be added in future but they probably would only concerned developpement, the goal is to have a basic project without any specific bundle.
